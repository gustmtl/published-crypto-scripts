# Published Crypto Scripts
Random scripts I wrote about crypto.


### querying_aavev2_thegraph.py
This one is querying info about assets available in Aave V2 by using The Graph Protocol.


### share_of_cryptomarketcap.py
This script plots the share of the crypto market each crypto represents, both for the total market and for the altcoins market (without accounting for BTC).
